# Assignment
This is the github repository for my Web3D applications module. The assignments details are as follows:

To meet these assignment requirements a successful student is required to build a X3D based Coca Cola Branded (3D App) exploiting HTML5,
CSS3, X3D (X3DOM), JavaScript (you should utilise one or more of the JavaScript APIs such as jQuery, and a JavaScript frontend framework, 
e.g. Bootstrap 4), AJAX for asynchronous update of HTML contents, JSON for data transfer from the backend to the frontend, PHP to access 
data from a SQLite database, and all configured in a MVC design pattern. You should refine your Lab 3D Models to improve their geometry, 
materials, lighting and camera definition. Your 3D models should be accessed through your Coca Cola Branded User Interface allowing them 
to be manipulated in 3D space

I used Cinema4D to create my 3D models.
